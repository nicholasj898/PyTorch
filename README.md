# PyTorch Projects

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks demonstrating data cleaning, validation, software design patterns, and model evaluation using PyTorch and Python.

## Notebooks

- `drink_snack_sales_cleaning.ipynb`: Cleans raw drink and snack sales data by handling missing values and removing duplicates. Saves cleaned datasets for analysis.

- `data_quality_checks_drink_snack.ipynb`: Validates the cleaned datasets through null checks, type validation, and basic statistical summaries.

- `xyz_design_patterns_singleton_builder.ipynb`: Demonstrates the use of Singleton and Builder design patterns in Python using a local business search system as the example. Includes code and UML diagrams.

- `model_evaluation_sales_forecasting.ipynb`: Applies forecasting models to the cleaned datasets and evaluates their performance using metrics such as MAE and RMSE.

## Tools and Libraries

PyTorch, pandas, numpy, matplotlib
